FPR Coursework Submission
James Siddle, 24th July 2006
============================

I opted for a modular approach to writing the FPR courswork, so the 
submission is made up of several files, all should be found in the 
file "jsiddle_fpr.zip":

submission note.txt 	This file
webhandler.lhs		Main web handler code
sumservice.lhs		The sum service
webparser.lhs		Associated parser functions
htmlpage.lhs		HTML page data structures and functions

Answers to exercises
====================

The submitted files make up the final program from the FPR exercises. 

To make it easier to mark the coursework submission I opted to point out where 
each exercise has been answered in the final program, though the submitted code 
may bear little resemblance to the original code that was written for some of 
the early questions.

I'd like to suggest that the coursework description be modified to make it 
clearer what should be submitted, as Jackie's email about coursework assessment 
came too late for me to clean up my submission as I would have liked.

Thanks,
James Siddle


Exercise 1: 
-----------
The answer to exercise 1 is composed of several parts of the final program. 
The top-level web-handling is done in "webhandler.lhs", which delegates parsing 
of the query to the "dict" parser that can be found in "webparser.lhs", and 
delegates handling of the parsed query to the sumservice function in 
"sumservice.lhs". 

The sumservice function generates the resulting webpage based on the parsed 
query input, using the HTML data structures in "htmlpage.lhs".

If the sumservice function receives an invalid query, it displays an error
page.

Exercise 2: 
-----------
The parser for CGI query strings can be found in the file "webparser.lhs", in the 
functions "dict", "queryElement", and associated parsers. In the final program, 
these functions are polymorphic to support parsing of string values as well as 
the required integer values (see exercise 7 for why I did this).

Query string parsing calls can be seen in the main function, in "webhandler.lhs".

Exercise 3: 
-----------
This exercise is answered by the functions "suminitial", "summiddle", "sumfinal",
and "sumerror" in the file "sumservice.lhs".

Exercises 4 and 5:
------------------
The top half of the file "htmlpage.lhs" contains the answers to these exercises,
consisting of the "HTMLBlock" and "HTMLInputType" data structures plus associated types,
followed by an extended version of the "HTMLBlock" show instance.

Exercise 6:
-----------
The answer to this question can be seen in "sumservice.lhs". The program handles the 
staged addition through a single function, "sumservice".

The "sumservice" function determines the stage for a particular query, while 
the "suminitial", "summiddle", and "sumfinal" functions provide the particular
handling for each stage.

The hidden field containing the first entered value can be seen in the 
"summiddle" function.

Exercise 7:
-----------
As described above, the "sumservice" function in "sumservice.lhs" provides
the three modes of execution required by this exercise. 

Originally this function determined the stage of execution through the existence of 
the required input fields, however this was augmented with an additional "stage" 
field which described the specific stage that was being requested. 

This was just an additional "belt and braces" check, added both to improve the 
resulting program but also to drive the creation of a polymorphic dictionary
parser to satisfy my own interest and curiosity in this area.
